### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The code for the main interface with the user. It allows the user to choose from two scoring methods (i.e., traditional or categorical), write down a root concept, file selection, and a path selection to save the results.
It also includes a *Help*, *Run*, and *Exit* buttons.
### Scoring Methods
Each scoring method will run independently under the GUI and will generate a *ScoringResult* file in the path selected by the user.
# How to Use the EM Cmap Scoring Tool
### Please open "Cmap Tools" and check the following:
- Check for misspellings via *Tools* -> *Spelling...*.
- Check for hierarchical structure via *Format* -> *Autolayout*.
- Check that all concepts are in a concept bubble in one line.
	- The spelling should be the same throughout the maps that will be scored.
- Save the revised Cmaps as .cxl files via *File* -> *Export Cmap As* -> *CXL File...*.
### Using EM Cmap Scoring Tool:
1. Select the scoring method. You can choose either **Traditional** or **Categorical**.
