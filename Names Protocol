# Names protocol
The following document describes the rules for naming variables and functions, as well as some general good programming practices for presenting them in the code.

## General rules:
-	All variables will be listed at the top of the program file, after the imports.
-	Instances will be listed at the top, after variables.
-	Functions prototypes will be listed at the top, after instances.
##Variables and Functions:
Variables will follow the template presented below:
vScopeType_name
Functions will follow the template presented below:
fScopeType_name

| ID |	Scope |	Type |	Underscore |	name |
|------|------|
| v |	Loc	L(ist) |	_	| alpha
| 	| Glo	T(uple) |	_	| bravo
|		| C(har) |	_	| charlie
|		| F(loat) |	_	| delta
|		| I(nt) |	_ |	echo

e.g., vGloL_concept
## Instances and Objects
Instances will follow the template presented below:
iClass_name
e.g., iLabel_frame, iLabel_rootconcept, iCheckbox_trad
Objects will follow the template presented below:
