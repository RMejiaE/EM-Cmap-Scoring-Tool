## ðŸ“‹ Wordbank update
The Wordbank file was updated to have only one concept per cell for the test performed.
The updated version can be seen in [Wordbank](https://github.com/RMejiaE/EM-Cmap-Scoring-Tool/blob/main/Phase_3_4/WordBank.csv) under this phase folder.
## ðŸ”® Manual Categorization Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The manual categorization GUI presents the user the information of the concepts that did not have any category becuase they are not present in the [Wordbank](https://github.com/RMejiaE/EM-Cmap-Scoring-Tool/blob/main/Phase_3_4/WordBank.csv) file. In this interface, the concepts are presented in the first column, the pre assigned category based on the implemented algorithm, and a dropdown menu. The drop down menu is set by default to the pre assigned category, but the user can choose another category if they find it more appropriate.

The options for the manual categorization GUI are *Accept all assignement* and *Reject all assignements and leave all concepts in "No category"*.
- If the user would like to leave the concepts in the pre assigned categories or manually select a category for one or more concepts, the *Actions* menu should be left in *Accept all assignements*. For a  manual selection, the user must choose the desired category from the dropdown menu for the categories that they want to change and finally click on *Continue*.
- If the user would like to leave the concepts in *"No category"*, the *Actions* menu should be switched to *Reject all assignements and leave all concepts in "No category"*. Finally, the user must click on *Continue*

After clicking *Continue*, the program will either present the next Cmap for manual categorization or end the execution, and present the message window indicating that the categorical scoring was performed succesfully.
